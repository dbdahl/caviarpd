Description: CaviarPD uses random partition distributions and pairwise distance information to perform 
             cluster analysis. This package contains the implementation of this clustering 
             method, compatible with both the EPA and ddCRP distributions. Users can simply 
             draw samples from these distributions, or draw samples and then use them to obtain 
             and plot clustering estimates. Implementations for mass selection algorithms are 
             also given since a mass parameter is required to obtain a clustering estimate. 
             Since pairwise distances make up the input to this procedure, CaviarPD is most 
             comparable to hierarchical clustering.
